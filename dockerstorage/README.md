# Docker Storage

## 1: What storage drivers does Docker support?

Docker supports several different storage drivers, using a pluggable architecture. The storage driver controls how images and containers are stored and managed on your Docker host.

## 2: Which storage driver is best for my workload?

There are three high-level factors to consider while you make this decision -

- If multiple storage drivers are supported in your kernel, Docker has a prioritized list of which storage driver to use if no storage driver is explicitly configured, assuming that the prerequisites for that storage driver are met:

If possible, the storage driver with the least amount of configuration is used, such as btrfs or zfs. Each of these relies on the backing filesystem being configured correctly. Otherwise, try to use the storage driver with the best overall performance and stability in the most usual scenarios.

overlay2 is preferred, followed by overlay. Neither of these requires extra configuration. overlay2 is the default choice for Docker CE.

devicemapper is next, but requires direct-lvm for production environments, because loopback-lvm, while zero-configuration, has very poor performance.

The selection order is defined in Dockerâ€™s source code. You can see the order by looking at the source code for Docker CE 18.03.
Refer : https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/blob/18.03/components/engine/daemon/graphdriver/driver_linux.go#L50 

```
// List of drivers that should be used in an order
	priority = "btrfs,zfs,overlay2,aufs,overlay,devicemapper,vfs"
```

You can use the branch selector at the top of the file viewer to choose a different branch, if you run a different version of Docker.Your choice may be limited by your Docker edition, operating system, and distribution. For instance, aufs is only supported on Ubuntu and Debian, and may require extra packages to be installed, while btrfs is only supported on SLES, which is only supported with Docker EE. See Support storage drivers per Linux distribution.

Some storage drivers require you to use a specific format for the backing filesystem. If you have external requirements to use a specific backing filesystem, this may limit your choices. See Supported backing filesystems.After you have narrowed down which storage drivers you can choose from, your choice are determined by the characteristics of your workload and the level of stability you need. See Other considerations for help making the final decision.
